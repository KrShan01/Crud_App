CRUD app built with react

To set up and run a React application from a GitHub repository, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then run the following command:
                                                     git clone <repository_url>
   Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.


2.	Install dependencies: Navigate into the cloned project folder using the cd command in your terminal. Once inside the project folder, run the following command to install the necessary 
    dependencies:
                                                          npm install
    This command will install all the required dependencies specified in the package.json file.
  	

3.	Run the application: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server and run the application using the following command:
                                                           npm start
    This command will start the development server and launch the React application in your default web browser. You should be able to see your React application running.
